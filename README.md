Heart Disease on Databricks

Heart Disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, making early detection critical for saving lives. In this project, we combine SQL-based data exploration and SparkML-based predictive modeling to analyze patient data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Our goal is to uncover key risk patterns, identify high-risk patient profiles, and build robust machine learning models that can accurately predict the presence and severity of heart disease.

Dataset 
Heart Disease dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Heart Disease Dataset

Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle

Project Goals:
Analyze data using SQL queries
Created ML models to predict heart disease diagnosis and severity of heart disease

Analysis was performed by uploading data on Databricks
The .ipynb are Databricks notebooks meant to be imported and run at: https://community.cloud.databricks.com/ (community edition account needed)
